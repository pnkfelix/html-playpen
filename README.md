============

Area for Felix to put html (5 or otherwise) related experiments

To use the score-keeper, you need to download
* `score-keeper.html` (save as whatever; `score-keeper.html` works),
* `modernizer.js` (saved here as `modernizr-v2.6.1.js`),
* `jquery.js` (saved here as the minified file `jquery-1.8.2.min.js`
  and the original source `jquery-1.8.2.js`; download either one).
